 For each stapler, the cost of insourcing production is
$(0.75+0.4+1.1)
=$2.25
 For each stapler, the cost of outsourcing production is
$(0.95+0.55+1.4)
=$2.9
Insource production have a lower cost than out sourcing production, therefore we would use insourcing production whenever possible.
The time used for producing one stapler for location A 
=0.03+0.02+0.05 hour
=0.1 hour
The time used for producing for one stapler for location B 
=0.04+0.02+0.04 hour
=0.1 hour
The time used for producing for one stapler for location C 
=0.02+0.03+0.01 hour
=0.06 hour
For each 0.6 hour location A can produce
 0.6 hours ÷ 0.1 hour per stapler
=6 staplers
For each 0.6 hour location B can produce
 0.6 hours ÷0.1 hour per stapler
=6 staplers
For each 0.6 hour location C can produce
 0.6 hours ÷ 0.06 hour per stapler
=10 staplers
In 0.6 hours, if three locations work together,  10+6+6 = 22 staplers can be produced.
In each hour, "22÷0.6=36 2/3 staplers can be produced.
In 400 hours,  36 2/3 ×400 = 14666 staplers (round down to the nearest integer) can be produced in the company.
The rest is sent to sub-contractor for production since the insource production is full.
18000-14666 = 3334 staplers need to be produced by sub-contractor.
The total production cost is 14666 × $2.25 + 3334 × $2.9
= $42670
